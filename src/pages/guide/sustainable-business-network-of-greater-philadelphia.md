## Divi Overview

Divi builder is a framework that allows clients to edit content in an intuitive and painless way. Pixel Parlor uses the regular page builder released by Elegant Themes. Please do not use the “Visual Builder” on this site.

### Divi Builder

#### Editing Divi Sections:

![Editing a Divi section](https://images2.imgbox.com/03/b5/2f8RUvMo_o.gif)
To edit a background image: Click the hamburger icon on the blue box.

![Editing a background](https://images2.imgbox.com/18/cb/3tmtfPaL_o.gif)
From here you can change the background image, color, gradient, or video (only change what is already there).

**First Tab**: Section Background Color

**Second Tab**: Section Background Gradient

**Third Tab**: Section Background Image (highlighted above)

**Fourth Tab**: Section Background Video

Click on the desired tab to change your image, then click on the image preview.

![Choosing a background image](https://images2.imgbox.com/c3/6a/AtZtf2MC_o.gif)
This will bring up a lightbox that will give access the media library. Choose the image that you want and click the “set as background”.

#### Editing Divi Inner Content Modules:

![Editing a Divi module](https://images2.imgbox.com/8e/9f/SwXMsnfs_o.gif)
Using a “blurb module” as the example for this, you can enter the edit content area by clicking the hamburger Icon in the dark gray central boxes.

Once inside the content editor area, you can change the fields for text headers and sub-headers, text-areas for body copy, and there is also fields to change the images and hyperlinks.

![Content editor text fields](https://images2.imgbox.com/a6/56/Y9BzXPDI_o.jpg)
**Text fields** within the edit content area.

![Content editor image fields](https://images2.imgbox.com/95/f5/5xfCGqK0_o.jpg)
**Image fields** within the edit content area.

### Divi Libraries
Divi libraries are used to:

* Save/Load pre-made sections
* Save/Load pre-made pages
* Edit content that is being pulled into another page

If you need to reuse a previously made section or page, or if you need to replace a current section that is possibly not displaying right, or even if you want to save newly created sections and pages, the divi library is highly useful for templating and saving content types.

Depending on whether you are loading a section or a page, you need to load from the Divi library differently.

#### Adding a Section from the Divi Library:
![Adding Divi section from library](https://images2.imgbox.com/9b/1b/5KaCoUUz_o.jpg)
To load a section onto a page from the library, simple click “Add from library”, below the section of where you want your new pages to load. Your new section will then be loaded beneath the the link you clicked on.

![Loading layout screen](https://images2.imgbox.com/4f/7f/atJPvEnZ_o.jpg)
From here, just select the section that you want to load and it will appear on your layout editor.

#### Adding a Page layout from the Divi Library:
![Adding layout to page](https://images2.imgbox.com/a8/b9/ie7IUPHr_o.jpg)
To load a pre-made page layout onto a new page:

Create your new page. The Divi Page builder should be already loaded as soon your new page is created. If it is not, please click the large purple “Use The Divi Builder” near the top of the edit page dashboard area.

![Recording of all the past steps](https://images2.imgbox.com/b6/c2/95FfI1KI_o.gif)
If the button happens to be green, and says “Use default Editor”, then Divi is already loaded and you don’t need to touch anything.

After Divi Builder is initiated, click “Load from library” in the purple Divi builder menu.

From here, select “Add From Library” , not “Predefined Layouts”, then click “load”, and you layout will populate the page.

#### Edit a Divi Library
![Divi Library](https://images2.imgbox.com/e5/c4/D9vnvXQa_o.jpg)
The edit library section should only be used to edit content areas that are being pulled into other pages of the website.

To get to the “Divi library”, in the WordPress Sidebar hover your mouse over “Divi”, then click “Divi Library”. The only area of the site that may require editing in a Divi library are the tabs on the School partners page. To do this, search “SBC Partner Layout Sections” in the Divi library. There is a custom layout for each tabs that is named accordingly. Choose your desired layout and edit as you would a normal Divi layout.

## Modify Page Content

## Connectivity Issues
##### No matter the web host or site platform, server maintenance, bandwidth problems, or other unexpected issues can arise once in a while. Best case scenario, there’s a few seconds of downtime in the middle of the night once a year or so, but worst case, something happens that brings the site down during the work day. Everything is fixable, and we generally advise these things if you cannot access your website:

1) Check the site from another network (ie: if it’s down in your office, check the site with cellular data, not wi-fi). This will help rule out an internal server issue at your office, if it is also inaccessible on your phone, without wi-fi.

2) Feel free to call or email us.

3) If we’re not able to respond immediately, you can check on the system status of your webhost. For Dreamhost, for example, it can be found here. That can provide a quick visual as to if this is a known issue for the web host.

4) Either we can contact the web hosting company on your behalf, or you can reach out to them. With Dreamhost, this is likely via online chat (to which they are quite responsive), or with other hosts, this may be a phone call (GoDaddy, for example).

5) Either the host can restart the server to fix the issue, or can help shed some light on a larger issue that is impacting multiple customers.

Downtime is our least favorite thing, and we try to help our clients bring their sites back up ASAP should it occur.

## WordPress Updates
##### Minor WordPress core updates will happen automatically, and major updates may require manual confirmation. Additionally, plugins will require updates from time to time. Pixel Parlor can assist with these on a quarterly, or as-needed basis.

Any other questions? Feel free to reach out to [Andrew Nicholas](mailto:andrew@pixelparlor.com) or [David Elster](mailto:david.elster@pixelparlor.com), and we’ll be happy to help.
